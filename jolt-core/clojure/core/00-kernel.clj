;; before it is built. So this tier is loaded FIRST and, in compile mode, is
;; bootstrap-compiled directly into clojure.core (not routed through the
;; self-hosted pipeline, which would need these to already exist — the
;; circularity that previously forced `second` to stay a host primitive). With this tier
;; in place the analyzer is built against the Clojure definitions.

;; vec/map/apply/assoc/get/…, all hardwired to host primitives) and on each other.

;; Clojure's own definition: the single-collection arity is a transient fold.
;; This was (vec (apply map f colls)) for a long time because the fold measured
;; SLOWER here (5053 ns against 2298 over 32 elements) for no reason anyone
;; could name. Re-derived 2026-09-17: the reason was in conj! and make-pvec, not
;; the fold — conj! was variadic and consed a rest list per element, and
;; make-pvec built anything past 32 elements by conj, copying the tail each
;; time. With both fixed (transients.ss, collections.ss) the fold is 0.7 µs /
;; 0.7 KB against 1.6 µs / 6.2 KB over 32 elements, and 535 µs / 0.9 MB against
;; 1317 µs / 4.6 MB over 26k — the lazy map's cells and the seq->list copy are
;; what the old body paid for. The transient gate pins the per-element bytes.
