;; run-accfix.ss — a binding rebound through a feedback loop is not typed from its
;; initial value alone (jolt.passes.types infer-reduce-hof / reduce-acc-type).
;;
;; A reduce closure's accumulator is the init on the FIRST call only; after that
;; it is whatever the closure returned. Seeding it from the init alone proved a
;; nil init :nil, so nil?/some? folded to constants and the reduce answered with
;; the wrong element; a string init proved it :str, so string? folded true and
;; count lowered to the string primitive, which crashed on the first number; a 0.0 init pinned a ^double
;; hint on it, so a long the closure returned came back coerced. The seed is now
;; the fixpoint of the init joined with the closure's return. Pinned here on the
;; per-form inference path (predicate must survive in the emission, value must
;; match the JVM), on the whole-program path (the accumulator handed to a defn
;; must not narrow that defn's param either), on a nested reduce whose inner init
;; is the outer accumulator, and on the loop/recur analogue. The 0.0-init shape
;; whose closure always returns a flonum keeps its fl-ops.
