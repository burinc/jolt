;;
;; A single global transaction lock gives correct serializable semantics on
;; jolt's shared-heap threads — no MVCC needed.  Transactions buffer writes
;; in a per-txn log and only commit (write ref values) on success, providing
;; rollback on exception.  Watches fire once per changed ref after commit,
;; outside the transaction lock, matching JVM semantics.
;;
;; The lock IS the isolation, and it is an object MONITOR rather than an OS mutex
;; because a mutex cannot carry that across a fiber park — see stm-lock below
;; (jolt-pb2s), and dyn-with-txn for the other half, which is *txn* itself
;; (jolt-49ay).
;;
;; Refs participate in the IRef seam (watches/validators/metadata) like
;; atom/var/agent.  Loaded after atoms.ss (shares jolt-iref-state-throw and
;; the iref tables).

;; Refs travel in state images by VALUE (state-image.ss substitutes an
;; image-ref descriptor on dump and re-mints through make-jolt-ref on
;; restore), so this layout is NOT image-format surface and may change
;; freely. The uid jolt-ref-v1 is RETIRED: format-2 images carry refs as raw
;; nongenerative jolt-ref-v1 records (fields: val lock), and the legacy
;; restore arm depends on materializing that rtd from the fasl without a
;; live conflict — never reuse the v1 uid for a different layout.

;; --- transaction state -------------------------------------------------------
;; A single global lock serializes all transactions.  Per-thread *txn* detects
;; nested dosync (joins the outer transaction) and guards against io!/ref-set/
;; alter/commute/ensure outside a transaction.
;;
;; AN OBJECT MONITOR AND NOT A MUTEX, and that is the isolation (jolt-pb2s).
;;
;; This was (define stm-lock (make-mutex)) taken through jolt-with-mutex around the
;; whole transaction body. An OS mutex has THREAD granularity and a fiber is not a
;; thread, so it cannot carry an invariant across a park — and jolt-with-mutex is a
;; dynamic-wind, so a fiber that parks inside the body RELEASES it on the way out
;; and re-acquires it on resume. That is exactly what locks.ss says makes parking
;; inside jolt-with-mutex safe, and exactly what a transaction cannot survive:
;; another transaction ran and COMMITTED inside this one's extent, and this one then
;; committed writes derived from reads that predated it. Measured: a fiber reading
;; r = 0, parking, and writing read+1 while a second transaction committed r = 100
;; left r = 1, where the only serializable outcomes are 100 and 101.
;;
;; There is nothing downstream to catch it. jolt's STM has no MVCC and no retry —
;; the lock IS the isolation — so dropping it mid-body drops the only mechanism
;; there is, silently. And this is a scenario the design commits to rather than one
;; to rule out: fibers.ss carries *txn* in the per-fiber dynamic slice precisely so
;; that a fiber parked inside a dosync resumes inside its txn.
;;
;; So exclusion is carried the way jolt-3a87 carries an object monitor's: by an
;; OWNER FIELD keyed on the execution context, which a context switch cannot
;; disturb because it is not a wind. jolt-with-monitor is that lock already — its
;; bookkeeping mutex is held only across the enter/exit decision, a fiber contender
;; PARKS on the monitor's waiter list (never a condition-wait, which would block the
;; carrier the holder may need in order to reach its commit) and a thread waits on
;; its condition, and its after-thunk asks jolt-park-unwinding? so a park keeps
;; ownership. Nothing here has to know any of that; it just has to stop using a
;; mutex for a region that spans user code.
;;
;; The second thing this buys is jolt-d7l5: a monitor holds no COUNTED lock while
;; the body runs, so a fiber inside a transaction is preemptible again. Under the
;; mutex it was not, for the whole body, which is reason 3 of the three ways the
;; monitor itself failed — an unbounded starvation window over arbitrary user code.
;;
;; WHAT IT TRADES. Two transactions that today interleave over a park will now
;; serialize, and a program relying on that interleaving to make progress can
;; deadlock instead. That is jolt-3a87's call again: a hang is diagnosable and a
;; lost update is not.
;;
;; The lock-order rule the loader rests on is unchanged — a load must never acquire
;; this lock (loader.ss ldr-libs-update!), which is what keeps stm-lock -> ns_load
;; acyclic — and it is if anything easier to hold now, since a fiber contender parks
;; instead of pinning its carrier.
;;
;; jolt-with-monitor lives in java/concurrency.ss, which rt.ss loads AFTER this
;; file; the reference resolves at call time, the same forward reference
;; jolt-alter-var-root makes from dyn-binding.ss and jolt-run-interruptible makes to
;; fibers.ss. Nothing runs a transaction before the boot finishes loading.
(define stm-lock (vector 'stm-lock))
(define *txn* (make-thread-parameter #f))

;; (dyn-with-txn txn thunk) — scope *txn* over a dynamic extent.
;;
;; NOT `parameterize`, and the reason is the rule dyn-binding.ss already states at
;; dyn-with-frame: a winder must not re-establish state the jolt-dslice already
;; carries (jolt-49ay). The dslice carries *txn* — that is how a fiber parked inside
;; a dosync resumes inside its own transaction — and Chez's parameterize is a SWAP:
;; one thunk is both the wind's before and its after, exchanging the parameter with a
;; saved slot. jolt-fiber-slice-restore! writes *txn* BEFORE the rewind runs that
;; swap, so the saved slot came back holding the transaction instead of the outer
;; nil, and the way out then restored the TRANSACTION. The fiber left its dosync
;; still inside one, and its next dosync saw (*txn*) non-nil, took the nested arm,
;; joined the dead transaction, took no lock at all and wrote into a log nobody would
;; ever commit. Measured with no preemption at all: three parked transactions in a
;; row committed once; under contention, 396 of 400 dosync calls joined a stale txn
;; and four transaction objects served four hundred transactions.
;;
;; So the same shape dyn-with-frame uses, for the same reason. The set happens ONCE,
;; outside the wind, so a rewind cannot re-establish anything; and the after-thunk
;; restores an ABSOLUTE value rather than swapping, so it is right however many times
;; the extent is left and re-entered. The slice is then the single owner of *txn*
;; across a switch, which is what fibers.ss says the design is.
;;
;; This is the ONLY parameterize the runtime had over a slice-carried parameter. The
;; others are over parameters the slice does not touch (the reader's mode, the
;; loader's sinks and flags), where the swap is sound because nothing else writes
;; them while the extent is unwound.
;;
;; Note the after-thunk here DOES fire on a park, which is the opposite of
;; jolt-with-monitor's just above it in jolt-sync — and the difference is which
;; mechanism owns the state across the switch. The slice owns *txn*, so letting it
;; revert and be restored is correct; the monitor owns its ownership field, so a park
;; must not release it. Both rest on a park being a CAPTURE park that rewinds, which
;; is what fn* opacity gives dosync (java/sm.ss's invariant; run-gosm.ss checks it).
