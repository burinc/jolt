;; boots in ~0.4s; when it is present and every file that went into it still has
;; the content it was built from (gate-boot-fresh.ss), load it instead.
;;
;; build-jolt writes the image itself: on a miss it compiles one beside the
;; flat.ss compile, from exactly the loads in the block below (jb-build-boot-
;; lines reads them out of this file), so the next build hits. Like gate-boot.ss,
;; a missing or stale image only costs time — the literal loads run and the build
;; is the same. manifest-check.sh pins the block against bld-runtime-manifest.
