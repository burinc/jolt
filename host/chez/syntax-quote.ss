;; syntax-quote form builders. A macro expander whose body was a syntax-quote
;; template (lowered by jolt.host/form-syntax-quote-lower) calls these at RUNTIME
;; to build the EXPANSION as READER forms (cseq list / pvec / pmap / tagged-set
;; pmap) so the on-Chez analyzer can re-analyze it. def-var!'d into clojure.core,
;; so the lowered body's
;; unqualified __sqcat/__sqvec/__sqmap/__sqset/__sq1 refs (which lower to var-deref
;; in prelude mode) resolve here.
;;
;; A list/vector/set template lowers to (__sqcat part ...) where each part is
;; either (__sq1 x) — a single non-spliced item — or a ~@ expr that evaluates to a
;; seqable spliced in place. A map template lowers to (__sqmap k v ...) with no
;; splicing (alternating key/value, already lowered).
;;
;; A LIST template is lazy past its first splice. The JVM reads `(a b ~@xs c) as
;; (seq (concat (list a) (list b) xs (list c))): building the form realizes the
;; head and nothing of xs, whose elements are produced only as the form is walked
;; past b. That order is observable wherever the walker interleaves evaluation
;; with walking — the top-level do, which evaluates each subform before it reads
;; the next one. A macro that expands to (do (create-type ..) ~@(map analyze ..))
;; and relies on create-type having run before the first method is analyzed
;; (SCI's deftype) got the map's whole output computed at quote time here, ahead
;; of every form in the do. So __sqcat builds the template's own items up to the
;; first splice as realized cells, and leaves the rest — that splice, and every
;; part after it — as a lazy tail forced when the walk reaches it. A template
;; with no splice is exactly the eager list it always was (one allocation per
;; item, no lazy cell), so the ordinary macro pays nothing for this.
;;
;; A vector or set template stays eager: the JVM applies vector / hash-set to the
;; concat, which realizes it all.
;;
;; Loaded by rt.ss after collections.ss/seq.ss (jolt-list/jolt-vector/jolt-hash-map/
;; jolt-seq, the lazy-src cells) and def-var!.

;; (__sq1 x): one template item, marked so the builders can tell it from a ~@
;; splice without touching the splice (any seq test on a splice would force it).
;; The marker never leaves this file: the lowering only ever hands an __sq1 form
;; to __sqcat/__sqvec/__sqset as a direct argument.
