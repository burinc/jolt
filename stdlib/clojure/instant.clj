;; clojure.instant — RFC3339 timestamp parsing and the `#inst` reader
;; constructors. The parser and the range validation are the reference
;; implementation's, unchanged (they are pure Clojure); only the constructors are
;; jolt's, because they build host values.
;;
;; Host-model notes:
;;
;;   - `java.sql.Timestamp` is `java.util.Date` on jolt (one instant type,
;;     millisecond resolution), so `read-instant-timestamp` truncates the
;;     nanosecond fraction to milliseconds instead of preserving it. It is kept
;;     as a distinct entry point because libraries bind it into *data-readers*.
;;   - `java.util.Calendar` on jolt holds an instant, not an instant plus a zone,
;;     so `read-instant-calendar` yields the right point in time but does not
;;     preserve the literal's offset zone the way the JVM's does.
;;   - print-method / print-dup for Date are NOT installed here: jolt's printer
;;     already emits `#inst "…"` in RFC3339 natively for both, so the reference's
;;     SimpleDateFormat-backed methods would only duplicate it.
