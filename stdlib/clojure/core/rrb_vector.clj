;; clojure.core.rrb-vector — a thin mapping onto jolt's native RRB pvec.
;;
;; The host (host-table.ss) binds jolt.host/catvec and jolt.host/slice to the
;; O(log n) pvec-catvec / pvec-slice in collections.ss; this namespace exposes
;; them with the core.rrb-vector API (catvec, subvec, vector, vector-of, vec).
;; jolt's pvec carries relaxedness in its nodes rather than as a distinct type,
;; so every result here is an ordinary jolt vector and interops with the rest of
;; clojure.core without conversion.
;;
;; DIVERGENCE from the JVM core.rrb-vector: vector-of. The JVM library packs
;; primitives into unboxed typed arrays (a genuine gvec). jolt has no per-type
;; unboxed vector, so vector-of coerces each element where a cast exists
;; (long/double) and stores a plain vector of the coerced values. The element
;; type is NOT retained — the result answers :object behavior throughout — so a
;; :long vector-of holds boxed longs, not packed longs. catvec/subvec over one
;; stay correct (they are ordinary vectors); only storage density differs.
;;
;; subvec here is the RRB slice (jolt.host/slice), NOT clojure.core/subvec
;; (which copies). Both agree on values for valid ranges.
;; catvec/subvec delegate to the O(log n) host pvec ops. They are called
;; fully-qualified (jolt.host/catvec, not :as host) because jolt's compiler
;; resolves a Prefix/member qualified symbol only against actual namespaces —
;; an :as alias is treated as a class and fails with "Unknown class". This
;; matches how the rest of jolt-core references jolt.host.
