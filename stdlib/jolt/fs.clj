  "File-system utilities: paths, files, directories, globbing, copy/move,
  timestamps, POSIX permissions, and symbolic links. The implementation is the
  vendored babashka.fs; jolt.fs is the public surface and exposes only the
  operations Jolt fully supports on this host.

  Path-valued results are java.nio.file.Path values. See
  https://github.com/babashka/fs for the API of each function."

;; The whole surface, zip/unzip/gzip/gunzip included: they run on the runtime's
