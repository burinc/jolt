;; Complexity gates: operations that must NOT be linear in the collection's size.
;;
;; Each of these was O(n) in jolt while the reference answers it from the shape,
;; and every one is invisible to a value test — the results were correct all
;; along, just derived by walking. Over 200k elements:
;;
;;   (count (seq v))        18.8ms   JVM 166ns   PersistentVector$ChunkedSeq is Counted
;;   (drop k (seq v))       18.5ms   JVM 625ns   ...and IDrop
;;   (rseq v)               19.8ms   JVM 209ns   rseq is documented as constant time
;;   (first sorted-map)      190ms   JVM 416ns   PersistentTreeMap.min() walks one spine
;;   (first sorted-set)       94ms   JVM 542ns
;;
;; The gate is the SHAPE, measured in one process: run each op at n and at 4n and
;; compare. A constant-time op holds near 1.0 and an O(log n) one barely moves
;; (4x the elements is two more levels of a ~17-deep tree); the linear versions
;; these replaced all sat near 4.0, so the ceiling has a wide margin either side
;; and does not depend on absolute timings, which differ per machine and flake
;; under parallel CI.
;;
;; What is compared is THROUGHPUT over a fixed time budget, not the time for a
;; fixed number of reps, because a fixed rep count cannot serve both ends of this
;; gate at once. The ops here are ~40ns when correct and ~20ms when broken — a
;; 500,000x spread. A rep count small enough to keep the BROKEN case from running
;; for an hour leaves the correct one measuring tens of microseconds, which is
;; under the noise floor of a shared CI runner: `rseq vector` failed on main at
;; ratio 3.22 with both arms reading 0ms, on a build where rseq is O(1).
;; Measuring how many ops fit in a budget instead makes every arm cost the same
;; wall time whatever its speed, and the batch self-calibrates past the ~1us
;; timer granularity, so neither end needs a hand-tuned constant.
