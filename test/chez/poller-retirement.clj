;; test/chez/poller-retirement.clj — retiring a registration must not cost the
;; poller its ability to report readiness. Run through jolt (wired into
;; host/chez/smoke.sh).
;;
;; WHY THIS EXISTS. Two regressions, one per platform, both from making the
;; poller's registrations per (fd, filter). Neither was caught by any gate:
;; poller-registration.clj is read-only on eight distinct fds, so no fd there ever
;; carries two filters and none of them closes while a delete for it is in flight.
;;
;; ROUND A — a refused delete must not wedge the loop (kqueue).
;; poller-round returns an empty event list for TWO different reasons: the wait
;; itself failed, or every entry the kernel reported was an EV_ERROR that got
;; filtered out. The loop carried its pending deletes forward on both, but an
;; EV_ERROR *is* the kernel having processed the changelist and refused an entry —
;; re-issuing that delete gets it refused again, forever. kevent returns as soon as
;; a changelist entry errors and reports only the error, so a single refused delete
;; stopped every readiness report in the process and spun a core doing it. A fiber
;; closing its own socket the moment its read returns is enough to produce one: the
;; kernel drops a closed fd from the kqueue set, so the delete the poller had
;; already scheduled for it comes back ENOENT. Unfixed this wedges within about
;; three rounds, and the ev-errors counter runs to seven figures.
;;
;; ROUND B — retiring one direction must not retire the other (epoll).
;; epoll keys a registration by fd and carries both directions in ONE mask; there is
;; no per-direction delete (EPOLL_CTL_DEL takes no mask and ignores one). So a bare
;; EPOLL_CTL_DEL issued to retire a fired :read also removes a :write registration
;; the same fd still has a fiber parked on — and that direction is not in :pending
;; any more, so nothing re-adds it and the writer never wakes. Before the split,
;; waiters were flat per fd and every event woke all of them, so a waiter that was
;; not ready re-registered and the loss healed itself; per-filter waiters removed
;; that. This round parks both directions of one socket at once and then lets the
;; read fire, which is the shape the whole (fd, filter) split exists to serve.
;;
;; Same watchdog structure as poller-registration.clj, and for the same reason: a
;; lost wakeup here presents as a hang, not a failure, so the MAIN thread does
;; nothing but watch a deadline while the workload runs on a spawned thread.

;; ---- round B: both directions of ONE fd parked at once -------------------------

;; retiring a fired :read with a bare EPOLL_CTL_DEL also drops a :write the same fd
;; still has parked — and that direction is no longer in :pending, so nothing re-adds
;; it. This round builds that shape: a writer that fills the socket until it parks on
;; :write, a reader parked on :read of the SAME fd, and then a byte that fires the
;; read.
;;
;; The shape is the hard part — the send buffer has to be genuinely full, and jolt
;; exposes no setsockopt to shrink it, so this writes until the poller table SAYS a
;; :write waiter is parked rather than assuming some byte count is enough. If it
;; never parks, the round reports :no-shape and the case FAILS: a round that quietly
;; passed without ever building its shape would gate nothing, which is how this hole
;; survived the case that was supposed to cover it.
