;; An interrupt that lands inside a monitor operation must not leave it held.

;;   chez --script test/chez/monitor-escape-test.ss
;;
;; run-interruptible ends its body by jumping out of a timer interrupt, so any
;; event check can be where a `locking` stops. This test interrupts a body with the
;; token already set and moves the tick its handler fires on across the whole
;; enter, body and exit, so every check point in between is the escape point once.
;; Afterwards the monitor must be free (or held at the depth an enclosing section
;; still owns), the wait set empty, and this thread's interrupt-disable and
;; counted-lock depths back where they started.
