;; test/chez/fibers-pool-test.ss — R5 gate: the carrier pool + the blocking
;; policy (epic jolt-nvpr.6). Run: chez --script test/chez/fibers-pool-test.ss
;; (wired into `make fibers` after the R4 go gate).
;;
;; R5 (fibers-r5-carriers.md) delivers two things:
;;   1. N carriers — OS threads, each running R4's loop shape (drain its run
;;      queue, park on its condition when empty, check+wait under one mutex) —
;;      started lazily at the first :fiber go spawn. N defaults to the
;;      machine's processor count and is overridable by a var
;;      (clojure.core.async/*fiber-carrier-count*), read once at pool start;
;;      the host setter jolt-fiber-carrier-count-set! (writes the var root) is
;;      what this gate uses. Fibers NEVER migrate (R0(d)): placement is
;;      round-robin at spawn, there is no work stealing, and growing the pool
;;      does not rescue fibers stranded behind a blocked carrier — that is
;;      documented where the pool is sized (fibers.ss), and gate 6 asserts the
;;      pinning behavior itself.
;;   2. The blocking policy: on a fiber, <!! and >!! park the fiber exactly as
;;      <! and >! do (on a fiber there is no difference); off a fiber they keep
;;      today's blocking ops, byte for byte.
;;
;; Gate checks (spec, in order):
;;   1. parallelism: M CPU-bound fibers over N carriers finish faster than the
;;      same M on one carrier — a RATIO measured within this one process.
;;      Timing is never asserted as an absolute duration; the two halves are
;;      measured back-to-back in the same run, so a slow or busy runner slows
;;      both and the ratio survives (see the flake history note at the top of
;;      fibers-test.ss — two absolute ceilings already shipped CI flakes).
;;   2. round-robin placement: fiber i lands on carrier (i mod N) — the
;;      distribution, not timing.
;;   3. <!! on a fiber PARKS: a sibling on the SAME carrier progresses while
;;      the first is blocked in <!! (fails if <!! blocks the carrier — the
;;      pre-change behavior; the gate is red without the policy, section 3).
;;   4. <!! / >!! off a fiber are unchanged: the same blocking semantics on a
;;      plain OS thread.
;;   5. two carriers mid-park simultaneously, each inside a try/finally, each
;;      finally running exactly once at the real exit — the check that
;;      justifies R4 keeping the park-unwinding flag in a virtual register
;;      (per thread) instead of a global (shared across carriers).
;;   6. a fiber that blocks its carrier by other means (a plain Thread/sleep)
;;      does NOT stop other carriers, and its own carrier's queued fibers DO
;;      wait — the documented pinning behavior.
;;
;; The gate mutates the pool size between sections via
;; jolt-fiber-carrier-count-set! + jolt-fiber-pool-reset! (stop threads, drop
;; the pool); each section pins what it needs before its first go/spawn.

;; --- 1. the carriers really do run at the same time -------------------------
;; A SPEEDUP assertion was tried here first and was wrong in principle: it
;; measures the machine, not our code. CI proved it — 1 carrier 204.40ms vs 4
;; carriers 202.48ms, speedup 1.01, on a runner with no real parallelism to give,
;; while the same check reads 5.34x locally. No ceiling makes that valid, and a
;; 1-CPU skip does not save it because a throttled runner still reports 4 CPUs.
;;
;; What IS about our code is whether two fibers on DIFFERENT carriers make
;; progress simultaneously, and that can be proved structurally: each waits for a
;; flag the other sets. If the carriers were serialized — one thread, or a pool
;; that secretly runs one fiber at a time — the first fiber would spin forever
;; holding its carrier and the second would never run, so the rendezvous could
;; not complete. It completes only under genuine concurrency, and it says nothing
;; about how FAST the machine is. The waits are bounded so a serialized scheduler
;; fails as a timeout instead of hanging CI.
;;
;; The timings are still printed, because they are useful to a reader — they are
;; just not assertions.
