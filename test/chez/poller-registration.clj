;; test/chez/poller-registration.clj — a readiness registration must never be
;; lost. Run through jolt (wired into host/chez/smoke.sh).
;;
;; WHY THIS EXISTS. jolt.io-poller's poller thread drained its pending
;; registrations in TWO critical sections — read :pending, then clear it — so a
;; registration landing in between was erased before it ever reached the
;; kqueue/epoll set. That fd's readiness was then never reported and the fiber
;; waiting on it never resumed. The window is microseconds wide, so it presented
;; as one fiber out of eight failing to finish, once, in a `make fibers` sequence,
;; and never again in six isolated runs of that gate.
;;
;; The workload keeps registrations landing while the poller is mid-round: rounds
;; of fibers that all park on their own socket read, over and over, so some
;; registrations are bound to arrive during the drain. Unfixed this loses ~11% of
;; them (283 of 320); fixed it loses none. The run STOPS at the first round that
;; loses one, because otherwise every subsequent loss pays the alts!! timeout
;; again: the unfixed version took over eleven minutes to finish what the fixed
;; one does in under two seconds, and a gate that slow is its own problem.
;;
;; This header used to claim that a lost wakeup is a FAILURE and never a hang,
;; on the grounds that every read is bounded by an alts!! timeout. It is not:
;; that timeout is itself a core.async channel, so the machinery this case exists
;; to stress is also the machinery the bound depends on, and .accept and the
;; socket setup are not bounded at all. A run did wedge — over ninety minutes,
;; main thread parked in a condition wait, poller thread in kevent — and reported
;; nothing (jolt-8tma). Hence the watchdog: the MAIN thread does nothing but
;; watch a deadline, and the workload runs on a spawned thread, so a wedge fails
;; the case and names the round and phase it stopped in. That way round because
;; the watcher must be the one thread that cannot be what wedges — every socket,
;; fiber and channel in this case belongs to the workload. (It was also the only
;; way round that worked when this was written: System/exit on a spawned thread
;; unwound that thread and left the process running, which is jolt-7xls, fixed
;; since.) What made that one run wedge is still unknown; this is what will say
;; where it was the next time.
