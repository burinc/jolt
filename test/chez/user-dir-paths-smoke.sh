# Relative paths under bin/jolt resolve against the CALLER's directory (#1241).
#
# bin/jolt exports the user's cwd as JOLT_PWD and then cd's to the checkout, so
# the runtime's own relative loads work. java.io, spit/slurp and ProcessBuilder
# already root a relative path at JOLT_PWD (io.ss project-relative), but the
# jolt.host filesystem functions, clojure.core/load-file and jolt.host/sh went
# to the process cwd — the checkout. (spit "a") then (jolt.host/delete-file!
# "a") touched two different files, which is how a stopped nREPL left
# .nrepl-port behind, and a bb.edn string task ran in the checkout. A built
# binary never cd's, so this only shows from a checkout, which is why it is a
# script driving bin/jolt from a scratch directory rather than a unit row.
