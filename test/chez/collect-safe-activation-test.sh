# collect-safe-activation-test.sh — jolt's Chez kernel patch
# (host/chez/chez-patches/0001-lockfree-thread-activation.patch): collect-safe
# foreign calls without the tc mutex. Invoke from the repo root:
#   sh test/chez/collect-safe-activation-test.sh [chez]
#
# Two halves:
#   - collect-safe-stress.ss, on the Chez the gate runs: threads in
#     collect-safe calls (sleeps, a qsort whose collect-safe callback
#     allocates, freshly compiled foreign procedures whose code is young)
#     while others allocate and request collections. It passes on a stock
#     kernel too; on a patched one it is what pins the protocol (with the
#     collector's lock of a native thread's return code removed it crashes).
#   - collect-safe-cost.clj, on jolt: a :blocking call against a plain one in
#     one process. On a patched kernel the ratio must stay under 3 (it is
#     ~1.7; a stock kernel is ~8).
#   - collect-safe-scaling.ss, on any kernel: the tc mutex and a collection
#     with many parked threads, so a quadratic thread walk cannot come back.
#
# JOLT_REQUIRE_LOCKFREE_CHEZ=1 (set in CI, where every Chez is built with the
# patch) fails the gate when the kernel jolt runs on does not have it, so a
# stale cache or a patch that stopped applying cannot pass as "stock".
