# aot-cache-path smoke (trace-r5): a frame from a CACHED namespace must report an
# EXISTING source path.
#
# compile-file bakes the name of the file it read into the frame source objects.
# The AOT cache used to compile a pid-unique temp (base.tmp<pid>.scm) and rename
# it away, so every frame from a cache hit pointed at a path that no longer
# exists. This check drives a throwing app twice under a fresh JOLT_CACHE_DIR —
# cold (miss) then warm (hit) — and on the WARM run asserts that the path the
# RUNTIME reports for each frame exists on disk and is the final .scm, not a temp.
#
#   before:  (".../boom-74-E212836D-11.tmp12072.scm" 570)      <- missing
#   after:   (".../boom-74-E212836D-11.scm" 3 125)             <- exists
#
# Chez resolves a source object to line and column only when it can read the file,
# which is why the fixed form yields three values where the broken one yielded two.
#
# The path comes from the frame source objects (JOLT_DEBUG_FRAMES prints them),
# NOT from scraping the cached .so. Chez fasls are compressed, so `strings` over
# one returns mangled fragments: on Linux CI an earlier version of this check read
# "W.DXMDTLZWm5/…scm" for a real path of "/tmp/tmp.DXMDTLZWm5/…scm" and failed
# while the runtime was entirely correct. It passed on macOS, which is how it got
# this far. The runtime's own report is also what the trace actually resolves
# offsets against, so it is the right thing to assert on.
