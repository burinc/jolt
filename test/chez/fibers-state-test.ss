;; test/chez/fibers-state-test.ss — R2 gate for per-fiber dynamic state
;; (epic jolt-nvpr.3). Run: chez --script test/chez/fibers-state-test.ss
;; (wired in as part of `make fibers`).
;;
;; R0 settled the scope: `guard` and `parameterize` need nothing (a resumed
;; fiber's own handler catches; parameterize unwinds on park and reinstates on
;; resume). The one real bug: dyn-binding.ss pushes a binding frame by calling
;; the dyn-binding-stack thread parameter as a SETTER, and a setter write is
;; not undone by a continuation escape — a fiber that parks inside a binding
;; leaves its frames on the carrier, visible to the scheduler and to every
;; other fiber, and a second fiber popping its own frame can pop the parked
;; fiber's. set-chez-ns! leaks the same way. R2 fixes it by saving and
;; restoring the fiber's dynamic slice (dyn-binding-stack, current ns, *txn*)
;; in the switch.
;;
;; This file loads the FULL host runtime (rt.ss), because the slice tests need
;; the real dyn-binding-stack / chez-current-ns-param / *txn* parameters plus
;; the push/bind and STM seams. It drives them at host level
;; (jolt-push-thread-bindings / jolt-sync / jolt-ref-* / set-chez-ns!) rather
;; than through the overlay macros, so it stays a chez --script gate like
;; fibers-test.ss. The assert conventions match fibers-test.ss.
;;
;; Gate scenarios (spec, in order):
;;   1. `binding` in one fiber is invisible to another fiber on the same carrier.
;;   2. A parked fiber's binding frame is invisible to the scheduler — the exact
;;      R0 leak, as a regression test.
;;   3. A fiber's bindings are intact on resume after other fibers have pushed
;;      and popped their own.
;;   4. Two fibers on one carrier cannot join each other's transaction: a fiber
;;      inside a dosync parks, another fiber runs and sees no transaction — and
;;      cannot COMMIT one either while the first is still inside its own.
;;   5. Spawn conveys the parent's bindings (and does NOT convey its *txn*).
;;   6. The current namespace follows the fiber, not the carrier.
