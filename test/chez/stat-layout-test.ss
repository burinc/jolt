;; The struct-stat layout resolution (jolt-lang/jolt#798). Run:
;;   chez --script test/chez/stat-layout-test.ss
;;
;; nio-file reads st_mode and st_uid at offsets that are a per-platform ABI, and
;; it used to pick them from the host's IDENTITY alone. A portable-bytecode
;; build has no identity to read — its machine tag names neither OS nor arch —
;; so every pb build fell through to "unverified struct stat layout" and refused
;; getPosixFilePermissions and getOwner, on hosts whose layout is one this file
;; has always known. Native aarch64 Linux refused for the same reason.
;;
;; The layout is measured now, so the interesting case is the one this host
;; cannot be: resolution with NO identity to go on. That is what the middle
;; block does — it runs the measurement alone and requires it to land on the row
;; identity would have proposed, which is exactly what a pb build depends on.
