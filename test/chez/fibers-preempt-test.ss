;; Fibers: preemptive scheduling (jolt-atc.2, swish's quantum — erlang.ss:872).
;;
;; Cooperatively scheduled fibers only leave their carrier at a channel op, so a
;; compute-bound go block pins that carrier and starves everything queued behind
;; it. R0(d) pins a fiber to its carrier for life, so growing the pool cannot
;; rescue the stranded work — the only fix is to take the carrier away.
;;
;; The gate pins the pool to ONE carrier so starvation is deterministic: fiber A
;; spins without ever yielding, fiber B is queued behind it. Cooperatively B can
;; never run. With a quantum it does.
;;
;; Loads the full runtime (rt.ss) because the preempt knob is read off a jolt
;; var and the handler needs the real carrier pool.

;; --- 10. reading the interrupt depth is a QUERY, not a delivery point --------
;; The scheduler asks for the current disable-interrupts depth on every switch,

;; both primitives return the new count, so a disable/enable pair tells you what
;; you started at. But that pair is not a read. An enable that brings the count
;; back to 0 delivers whatever was deferred while interrupts were off, and every
;; caller of this is on a park path that has already dropped its finally winders
;; and committed to leaving — the worst place in the runtime to run an arbitrary
;; handler. It now reads the thread-context field instead, as swish does.
;;
;; The re-entrancy check below is the one that distinguishes the two. A Chez
;; timer handler runs at disable-count 0 (probed, not assumed), so a handler that
;; re-arms and then asks for the depth is exactly the shape where the old pair
;; delivers: the disable defers the new tick and the enable hands it straight
;; back, re-entering the handler. Mutation-verified by restoring the pair.
