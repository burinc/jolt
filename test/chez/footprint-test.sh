# repo root with the binary to check (default target/release/jolt):
#   sh test/chez/footprint-test.sh [jolt]
#
# The rows, each a leak of memory that was measured, not modeled:
#   - pinned chunks: a vfasl boot loads straight into the static generation
#     while its temporary buffers (the decompressed image, the relocations) live
#     in chunks of their own. A stock kernel hands such a chunk's spare aligned
#     segment to the next allocation, a static one there pins the whole chunk,
#     and jolt held 76MB of empty chunks for its whole life
#     (host/chez/chez-patches/0002-oversize-chunk-spare-segment.patch). On a
#     kernel without jolt's patches the row reports and passes; on a patched one
#     (the lockfree entry is the marker, both ship together) it must be clean.
#   - const boot arrays: the boot image and the other embedded files are read
#     only, and the launcher madvises the boot. Over writable data that makes
#     every page a private dirty copy on macOS (14MB per process); const puts
#     them in a read-only section, clean and shared.
#   - the GC policy's live baseline: it was read from bytes-allocated before any
#     collection, startup garbage and all (155MB against 62MB live), and sized
#     the nursery and the old-generation growth limit from that. The first
#     collection must report a baseline no bigger than the heap after it.
