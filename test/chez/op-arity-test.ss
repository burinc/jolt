;; Every numeric fast-path op, at every arity it admits — DERIVED from op-registry
;; rather than hand-listed, so a specialization added later is covered the moment
;; it lands. Run:
;;   chez --script test/chez/op-arity-test.ss
;;
;; What this pins. op-registry names one Scheme proc per numeric kind (:dbl/:lng/
;; :bd) and emit-numeric splices the call's operands into it. That is sound only if
;; the named proc accepts the operand count the emitter will hand it, and the
;; registry has no field that says whether it does — :arity gates which SOURCE
;; arities get lowered, not what the target proc takes. The assumption held for
;; years by luck of what was picked (fx+/fl+ are variadic Chez primitives, jbd-add
;; is variadic by construction), so when 0.5.2 moved ^long +/-/* onto the binary
;; jolt-l+ every 3-operand long form stopped compiling and nothing noticed: every
;; probe that "covered" long arithmetic was written at arity 2.
;;
;; So each case asserts two things, and the second is the one that matters:
;;   1. the specialized form compiles and agrees with the generic value-position
;;      path (apply, which goes through the variadic overlay);
;;   2. the emitted code actually CONTAINS the specialization. Without (2) a case
;;      passes vacuously when the form silently fails to specialize — the precise
;;      way the gap stayed invisible.
