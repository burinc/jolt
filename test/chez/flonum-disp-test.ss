;; test/chez/flonum-disp-test.ss — finding a flonum's payload offset never
;; reads memory in front of the flonum. Run: chez --script test/chez/flonum-disp-test.ss
;; (wired into `make flonumdisp`, part of `make ci` and the windows-deps job).
;;
;; WHY (#1337). scheme-adapter-runtime.ss finds the payload's displacement from
;; a flonum's tagged pointer once at load, by probing 2.5 for its own bytes. The
;; probe used to count up from displacement 0. A flonum's storage starts AT its
;; payload (6 bytes past the tagged pointer on 64-bit Chez), so every probe below
;; the payload read bytes in front of the object. When the literal 2.5 was the
;; first object in a fresh segment and the memory before that segment was not
;; mapped, the first probe faulted. A MinGW-built scheme.exe has no handler for
;; the fault (POSIX Chez raises "invalid memory reference"), so the process died
;; at load with exit 139. Where 2.5 lands depends on everything allocated before
;; it, which is why the crash came and went with the shape of the console ports
;; (`> f 2>&1` merges stdout and stderr into one port, one port fewer) and with
;; unrelated bytes of cli.ss.
;;
;; The scenario is a REPRODUCER, not a smoke: it builds a flonum whose payload
;; is the first byte of a readable page right after an inaccessible one, and
;; runs the probe on it. The upward probe faults there on every host.
