# Apply jolt's Chez Scheme patches (host/chez/chez-patches/*.patch, in name
# order) to a cisco/ChezScheme source tree before it is configured:
#
#   sh ci/apply-chez-patches.sh <chez-src>
#
# Every workflow that builds Chez from source runs this right after the clone,
# and keys its Chez cache on the patches' hash, so a cached kernel is always
# the patched one. Idempotent: a patch that is already applied is skipped, so a
# tree restored from a cache or patched by an earlier step is left alone.
#
# The patches change the C kernel and two Scheme sources (s/7.ss,
# s/inspect.ss), so the kernel and boot files must come from the same patched
# build, which configure + make + install from one tree guarantees. A jolt
# built against a stock Chez (Homebrew, a distro) still works; it just pays
# the stock price for collect-safe foreign calls (see the comments in
# c/thread.c).
