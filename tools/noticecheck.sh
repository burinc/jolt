# noticecheck.sh — NOTICE stays true to the tree.
#
# jolt ships other people's code: submodules compiled into every binary, and
# files ported from Clojure, babashka and others. NOTICE names each one with
# its copyright and license, and the license texts live in licenses/. This gate
# fails when that record drifts:
#
#   - a submodule that is not test-only and that NOTICE does not name
#   - a licenses/ file NOTICE points at that is missing, or one it never names
#   - a source file or directory NOTICE names that does not exist, or a named
#     file without a copyright line in it
#   - a release archive or Nix package that leaves NOTICE or licenses/ out
#
# Run from the repo root: sh tools/noticecheck.sh (or `make noticecheck`).
